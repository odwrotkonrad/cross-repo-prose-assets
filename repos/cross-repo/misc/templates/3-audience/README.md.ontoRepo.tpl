# Misc

Shared CI scripts rendered into every workspace repo.

## Release

Every merge to main mints the next `vX.Y.Z` tag, patch by default, lifted by a `semver: major|minor|patch` commit token. The tag pipeline triggers [automation](https://gitlab.com/konradodwrot/cross-repo/automation), which re-renders the scripts into affected repos as regen MRs. Consumers pin this repo through `MISC_REF` (`GRP_KO_VAR_MISC_REF`):

```yaml
- source: "git::gitlab.com/konradodwrot/cross-repo/misc@vX.Y.Z"
  chmod: "0755"
  <<<:
    - source: //ci/semver-bump.zsh
      dest: ci/semver-bump.zsh
    - source: //ci/tag-mint.zsh
      dest: ci/tag-mint.zsh
```

## Templates

`ci/templates/TriggerAutomation.gitlab-ci.yml` is the one way a pipeline talks to [automation](https://gitlab.com/konradodwrot/cross-repo/automation): a hidden job the sender extends, forwarding one JSON `AUTOMATION_EVENT` (`type`, `source` filled from predefined variables, `details` the sender's payload). The sender sets `stage`, `rules`, `EVENT_TYPE`, `EVENT_DETAILS`:

```yaml
include:
  - project: konradodwrot/cross-repo/misc
    ref: $GRP_KO_VAR_MISC_REF
    file: ci/templates/TriggerAutomation.gitlab-ci.yml

trigger-automation:
  extends: .TriggerAutomation
  stage: trigger
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG =~ /^v[0-9]/
  variables:
    EVENT_TYPE: release.published
    EVENT_DETAILS: '{"producer":"misc","artifact":"cross-repo/misc"}'
```

Details computed by a script ride a dotenv report the trigger job `needs:`. This repo includes the template with `local:`.

## Layout

- `ci/`: the shared scripts. `semver-bump.zsh` prints the next tag, `tag-mint.zsh` mints and pushes it (CI: authed via `TAG_TOKEN`).
- `ci/templates/`: shared GitLab CI templates, included at `MISC_REF`.
