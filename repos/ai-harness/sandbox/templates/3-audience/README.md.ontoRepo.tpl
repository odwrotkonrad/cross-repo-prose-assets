# sandbox

Local claude session sandbox.

{{ renderMarkdown "assets/docs-agents/purpose.md" "normalize-headings" }}

## Layout

- `ci/k8s/kind.yml` — two-node kind cluster config (control-plane + worker), cluster name `sandbox`, `disableDefaultCNI` (Cilium is the CNI); session pods run on the worker (`sandbox.role: session`).
- `ci/k8s/limits.yml` — namespace `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange`: low default requests, a high per-pod ceiling, sized against the podman VM rather than the host.
- `ci/k8s/session.yml` — one StatefulSet per session (`replicas: 1`), its own PVC mounted at `/home/ko`, `${SESSION}` env-substituted at apply time.
- `ci/k8s/netpol.yml` — namespace default-deny, the FQDN allowlist, and an explicit host deny.
- `ci/docker/Dockerfile.{base,installs,config}` — the three image layers.
- `ci/zsh/scripts/` — zsh wrappers behind the Makefile targets.
- `ci/zsh/tests/e2e.zsh` — the host e2e test.

## Container provider

Podman, not docker: no docker daemon is involved. The machine runs **rootful**
(`machine-up.zsh` enforces it) because Cilium's eBPF datapath mounts
`/sys/fs/bpf` and writes `/etc/sysctl.d`, which a rootless container cannot do —
even with `--privileged`, since its user namespace never held `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`
over the host kernel. Node containers being root is confined to the podman VM,
never the developer's machine. Session pods are unprivileged regardless:
`runAsUser: 1000`, `runAsNonRoot`, every capability dropped.

## Image

Three layers, ordered by how often they change, each built on the host and
pushed to the host-local registry so only changed layers upload:

- **base** (`image-build-base`) — debian slim, zsh, tmux, vim, the `ko` user with
  passwordless sudo and root-group membership, and che. Changes rarely.
- **installs** (`image-build-installs`) — `che run --skip-ops` everything but
  `install-packages`. Slow, changes rarely.
- **config** (`image-build-config`) — `che run --skip-ops install-packages`:
  links, dirs, rendered templates and scripts, plus the workspace clone and the
  claude, gcp and gitlab credentials. Fast, changes often.

Profiles come from `configs` as remote refs (`ci/docker/che.yml`), never a
vendored copy: the sandbox owns which profiles apply, configs owns what each
does. CI builds neither image — it dry-runs the profiles instead.

`registry-up` starts a host-local `registry:2` (`kind-registry`,
`127.0.0.1:5001`), and a containerd mirror patch in `kind.yml` maps
`localhost:5001` to `kind-registry:5000` in-network, so nodes pull from the same
registry and pulls stay off the external network. It must be up before the
cluster is created, or the mirror patch does not resolve.

Claude is authenticated into the config layer at build time, taken unattended
from the host's own credential where one exists and from a throwaway login
container otherwise. A session that finds no authentication fails rather than
prompting.

## Use

```sh
$ make
$ make session-create
$ make session-attach
$ make session-attach SESSION=brave-amber-otter-lantern
$ make session-ls
$ make session-ls SESSION_STOPPED=1
$ make session-stop SESSION=brave-amber-otter-lantern
$ make session-rename SESSION=brave-amber-otter-lantern SESSION_NEW=review-work
$ make session-update-config
$ make session-rm SESSION=brave-amber-otter-lantern
$ make cluster-down
```

A session is one StatefulSet at `replicas: 1`, named a random mnemonic
(adjective-colour-creature-thing) so it can be said aloud and picked out of a
list. Its whole `$HOME` is its own PVC, seeded once from the image at creation
and never re-seeded. The container starts a detached `tmux` session, so closing
the terminal detaches and leaves the agent running; `session-attach` reattaches.

`session-stop` scales to 0, releasing cpu and memory while the PVC keeps the
data; attaching to a stopped session scales it back to 1 and the same volume
reattaches. `session-rm` deletes the StatefulSet **and** its PVC — a
`volumeClaimTemplates` claim outlives its StatefulSet by design, so without that
delete every removed session leaks its storage.

`session-update-config` rebuilds the config layer and recreates running pods on
it. Because a session's home is seeded once, an update reaches sessions created
after it; an existing session keeps the configuration it was seeded with.

## Traffic management

Session egress is Cilium-enforced default-deny. `ci/k8s/netpol.yml` holds three
objects: a namespace-wide default-deny over an empty `endpointSelector` (so it
covers every pod, including one carrying the wrong labels), the `sandbox-egress`
allowlist selecting session pods, and a clusterwide `egressDeny` on the host and
remote-node entities, since Cilium does not deny the host by default.

The allowlist admits cluster DNS (kube-dns, with resolution snooping so Cilium
can match FQDNs) and a fixed set of domains on 443 TCP, plus gitlab on 22. Raw
IPs, unknown domains and all plain HTTP on port 80 are dropped in-kernel; there
is no port-80 rule anywhere, so HTTP is denied even for allowlisted domains.

Cilium only enforces on an endpoint a policy actually selects, and an empty
`egress: []` leaves it allow-all — which is why default-deny is written as a
real rule. `session-create` refuses to run unless the policy is applied and
Cilium is ready, so no session exists in a window where egress is unenforced.

Cilium images pull from quay.io at install time (`cilium-up`), so cluster
bootstrap needs network.

**Extend the allowlist:** add one `matchName`/`matchPattern` line under
`toFQDNs` in the `sandbox-egress` policy and the matching DNS rule, then
`make netpol-up`.

**Observe egress:** `hubble observe --verdict DROPPED` names the session, the
destination and the port for a denied attempt, so a missing rule is diagnosable.
